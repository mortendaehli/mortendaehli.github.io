The idea is communicated to both machines and humans, and is brought to life when code is executed by a machine. To bring such an idea to life you need to follow certain rules. Most programmers are able to conform to these rules using a modern IDE and documentation.
This is where everything starts to get complicated. Should you do imperative og declarative programming?</description></item><item><title>Reading list</title><link>https://www.daehli.no/page/reading-list/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 11:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.daehli.no/page/reading-list/</guid><description>This is a curated list of reading material and code projects that I enjoy and recommend to others:

The goal is to increase unpaid, so-called organic, traffic by ranking high on search engines. This is the holy grail of Internet marketing.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing this guide because I&amp;rsquo;m currently helping out my family&amp;rsquo;s business over at Min Symaskin. The name translates to &amp;ldquo;My sewing machine&amp;rdquo;, and we are in the business of selling sewing machines.</description></item><item><title>Create a Ghost Blog using Azure Web Apps</title><link>https://www.daehli.no/project/2021-03-11-create-a-ghost-blog-on-azure-web-apps-using-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.daehli.no/project/2021-03-11-create-a-ghost-blog-on-azure-web-apps-using-docker/</guid><description>‚ö†Ô∏è This guide is outdated: Azure store account does not support this service anymore!

Have you ever wondered how you can host your own tech-blog? If you are like me, and you&amp;rsquo;ve built countless prototypes from scratch. They all work and do what they are meant to do.</description></item><item><title>Forecasting Covid-19 vaccinations in Norway</title><link>https://www.daehli.no/2021/03/10/2021-03-11-forecasting-covid-19-vaccnations-in-norway/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.daehli.no/2021/03/10/2021-03-11-forecasting-covid-19-vaccnations-in-norway/</guid><description>In this blog post, we will try to predict the Covid-19 vaccination race in Norway. We are all looking forward to getting &amp;ldquo;back to normal&amp;rdquo; - and wide vaccination coverage is probably the only realistic way to get there.
The question we are trying to answer is - how is the vaccine coverage going to be during the summer of 2021? I feel that the Norwegian government is pretty optimistic when it comes to vaccination rates.</description></item></channel></rss>
