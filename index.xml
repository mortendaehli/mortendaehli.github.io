My background is in Economics and Nanotechnology, but my professional career has been focused on advanced data analytics.
My primary focus at the moment is building cloud-based data platforms. I&amp;rsquo;m an avid DevOps practitioner - to be honest, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to just automate all the boring stuff and make sure it just works?</description></item><item><title>A complete Step-by-Step Google Search engine optimization guide</title><link>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2021/03/13/2021-03-13-search-engine-optimization/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Mar 2021 14:00:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2021/03/13/2021-03-13-search-engine-optimization/</guid><description>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of increasing the quality and quantity of traffic stemming from search engines. The goal is to increase unpaid, so-called organic, traffic by ranking high on search engines. This is the holy grail of Internet marketing.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing this guide because I&amp;rsquo;m currently helping out my family&amp;rsquo;s business over at Min Symaskin. The name translates to &amp;ldquo;My sewing machine&amp;rdquo;, and we are in the business of selling sewing machines.</description></item><item><title>Create a Ghost Blog on Azure Web Apps Using Docker</title><link>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2021/03/10/2021-03-11-create-a-ghost-blog-on-azure-web-apps-using-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2021/03/10/2021-03-11-create-a-ghost-blog-on-azure-web-apps-using-docker/</guid><description>Have you ever wondered how you can host your tech-blog? If you are like me, and you&amp;rsquo;ve built countless prototypes from scratch. They all work and do what they are meant to do. But something is off. They just don&amp;rsquo;t look any good, and they are not that user-friendly. I recently came across a solution, inspired by a fellow Bouvet colleague, I&amp;rsquo;m now running my very own blog in the cloud.</description></item><item><title>Forecasting Covid-19 vaccinations in Norway</title><link>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2021/03/10/2021-03-11-forecasting-covid-19-vaccnations-in-norway/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:10:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2021/03/10/2021-03-11-forecasting-covid-19-vaccnations-in-norway/</guid><description>In this blog post, we will try to predict the Covid-19 vaccination race in Norway. Most of us are looking forward to getting &amp;ldquo;back to normal&amp;rdquo; - and vaccination is probably the only realistic solution.
The question we are trying to answer is - how are the outlooks towards summer 2021? I feel that the Norwegian government is pretty optimistic when it comes to vaccination rates. Below is a facsimile from the Norwegian national newspaper VG visualizing prognosis data from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.</description></item><item><title>Creating a New Theme</title><link>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2014/09/28/creating-a-new-theme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2014 02:13:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2014/09/28/creating-a-new-theme/</guid><description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description></item><item><title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title><link>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2014/04/02/goisforlovers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 02:13:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2014/04/02/goisforlovers/</guid><description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description></item><item><title>Migrating from Jekyll</title><link>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2014/04/02/migrate-from-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 02:13:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2014/04/02/migrate-from-jekyll/</guid><description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
â–¾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ â–¾ images/ logo.png should become
â–¾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ â–¾ static/ â–¾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with Hugo</title><link>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2014/04/02/hugoisforlovers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mortendaehli.github.io/2014/04/02/hugoisforlovers/</guid><description>Step 1.
