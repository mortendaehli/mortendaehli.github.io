ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Morten DÃ¦hli Aslesen, and I'm currently working as an IT-consultant at [Bouvet Norway ASA](https://www.bouvet.no) where I've been since 2020. My background is in Economics and Nanotechnology, but my professional career has been focused on advanced data analytics.

My primary focus at the moment is building cloud-based data platforms. I'm an avid DevOps practitioner - to be honest, who doesn't like to just automate all the boring stuff and make sure it just works? In my spare time, I'm always working on something new. Solving something, learning something, creating something... Lately, I've been working on full-stack web applications, developed a [webshop for our family business](https://www.minsymaskin.no) and now I'm starting this blog to share with you all.

When I'm not hanging out with friends and family, and when I'm not in the digital world. Then I enjoy rock climbing, surfing, hiking, and generally everything that has to do with the great outdoors.

Check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) if you are curious about what Iâ€™m up to!
