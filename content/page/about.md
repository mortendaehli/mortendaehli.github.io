This is me 👋 Hi, I’m Morten Dæhli Aslesen, an IT-consultant at [Bouvet Norway ASA](https://www.bouvet.no)
since 2020. My academical background is in Economics and Nanotechnology, but in my professional career I have been
focusing on advanced analytics, machine learning, data platforms and software development.

I'm an avid DevOps practitioner, my mantra is simplicity, elegance, and pragmatism. I strive for clean, explicit code
and champion trunk-based development.. In my spare time, I'm always working on something new. Solving something,
learning something, creating something... Lately, I've been working on full-stack web applications, and I maintain
two webshops for our family business Min Symaskin and Quiltefryd AS. When I find the time, I will also write about
my own personal projects and my thoughts about IT and coding here in this blog.

When I'm not hanging out with friends and family, and when I'm not in the digital world. Then I enjoy rock climbing,
surfing, hiking, and generally everything that has to do with the great outdoors.

Check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/mortendaehli) if you are curious about what I’m up to!
