This is me ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Morten DÃ¦hli Aslesen, and I'm currently working as an IT-consultant at [Bouvet Norway ASA](https://www.bouvet.no) where I've been since 2020. My background is in Economics and Nanotechnology, but in my professional career I have been focusing on advanced analytics, machine learning, data platforms and software development.

I'm an avid DevOps practitioner, I prefer simple elegant and pragmatic solutions, clean explicit code and trunk based development. In my spare time, I'm always working on something new. Solving something, learning something, creating something... Lately, I've been working on full-stack web applications, and I maintain two webshops for our family business [Min Symaskin](https://www.minsymaskin.no) and [Quiltefryd](https://www.quiltefryd.no). When I find the time, I will also write about my own personal projects and my thoughts about IT and coding here in this blog.

When I'm not hanging out with friends and family, and when I'm not in the digital world. Then I enjoy rock climbing, surfing, hiking, and generally everything that has to do with the great outdoors.
