## About project

This is an effort to solve Advent of Code 2021 if I get the time! You will find my code adventure at [GitHub Advent of Code 2021](https://github.com/mortendaehli/advent-of-code-2021)

## Install

I am solving this using mostly python 3.9, but in order to build a proper environment you need to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and run

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mortendaehli/advent-of-code-2021.git
cd advent-of-code-2021
poetry install
```

Then you can explore each day in each sub-folder under advent_of_code_2021.
